    "## Fitting a diagonal covariance Gaussian mixture model to text data\n",

    "In a previous assignment, we explored k-means clustering for a high-dimensional Wikipedia dataset. We can also model this data with a mixture of Gaussians, though with increasing dimension we run into two important issues associated with using a full covariance matrix for each component.\n",
    " * Computational cost becomes prohibitive in high dimensions: score calculations have complexity cubic in the number of dimensions M if the Gaussian has a full covariance matrix.\n",
    " * A model with many parameters require more data: bserve that a full covariance matrix for an M-dimensional Gaussian will have M(M+1)/2 parameters to fit. With the number of parameters growing roughly as the square of the dimension, it may quickly become impossible to find a sufficient amount of data to make good inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these issues are avoided if we require the covariance matrix of each component to be diagonal, as then it has only M parameters to fit and the score computation decomposes into M univariate score calculations. Recall from the lecture that the M-step for the full covariance is:\n",

This means any data point with one of those words will have 0 probability of being assigned to that cluster since the cluster allows for no variability (0 variance) around that count being 0 (0 mean). Since there is a small chance for those words to later appear in the cluster, we instead assign a small positive variance (~1e-10). Doing so also prevents numerical overflow.\n",

To eliminate such bad outcomes, we first produce a suitable set of initial means by using the cluster centers from running k-means.  That is, we first run k-means and then take the final set of means from the converged solution as the initial means in our EM algorithm."
